# calculating-animation
One of the first actual projects I built was a simple 'Calculating' animation that would add up to 3 "." afâ€ er a certain period of time using javascript. This was back when I didn't know putting css, html and javascript all in one file was bad practice. The important part of this project: geting it to work! After a few days of scratching my head, back when I didn't even know what the Console tool is.
